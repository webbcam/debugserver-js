DebugServer-js
==============

DebugServer-js is a Javascript server that provides a simple API for
interacting with `Code Composer Studio`_'s `Debug Server`_ over TCP/IP. It is
based off of the `Test Server`_ example provided with Code Composer Studio.

Simply launch the server and connect to the specified port. You can then
send commands to the socket to control the DebugServer. Please see the
API for formatting your commands.
